# Tic tac toe in C!

### Information
This is just a simple project that I made in order to learn the syntax of C. I also wanted to learn how to write makefiles and how to link header files. I plan to expand this project by learning how to use ncurses and learn minmax for computer science knowledge.

### Setup
To build from source, you will need:
* Git
* A C compiler (change the makefile)

Then you can just clone this repository and then:
```bash
cd <to the folder where you cloned the repository>
cd src
make
cd ../build
./tictactoe
```
